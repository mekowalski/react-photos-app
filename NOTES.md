# FIRST: CHALLENGES
1. Some how getting user feedback
eg: typing a term in the search bar
2. Once search term is retrieved, how to use that term to make a request to an external API
- Use a free API to match the search term and return the results
3. How to render the list onto the browser display

# What Components to create?
[x] Create SearchBar Component responsible for just showing text at top of screen
  - will handle the typing event
[] Create PhotoList Component responsible for rendering a list of photos on the screen
[x] Will still have an App Component(most root)

- A couple of different Components will end up in the App Component
- Those different Components will have different CSS files
- Will not define App Component in `index.js`, it will be created in a Component file under /components

[x] Add a touch of styling to the input search bar with semantic ui

# Functionality
- How to handle user input in the search bar
