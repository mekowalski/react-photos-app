# Version 2
- [x] Show reasonably sized photos, currently the photos are too large
- [x] Use Grid CSS
- [x] Tile the shown photos
- [] Make images a bit more cohesive, the photos shouldn't have weird spacing but should be more closely fitted

- Use `grid-row-end:` rule but first need to specify the `grid-row-end` value depending on height of each individual photo
- [] Create new React Component for rendering one photo at a time
- [] Which will figure out the size of the image and adjust the `grid-row-end`
