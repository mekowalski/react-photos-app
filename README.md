# React Photos App

This is for diving deeper into React, including topics of: User events, Fetch and List display

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- With this Photos App I went into depth on handling user input with Forms and Events
- This application used the external API from Unsplash.com
- The connection provided returns photos that match the search term ie: dogs returns photos of dogs
- What was learned:
  - Component Design and project structure
  - Creating Forms for the user
  - Creating, altering and handling Events and Submittals
  - Solving Context Issues
  - Fetch vs Axios and `.then` vs Async Await
  - Controlled and Uncontrolled elements
  - Communicating from Child to Parent and invoking callbacks in Children
  - So far, different styling with Grid CSS/CSS and JS/React
