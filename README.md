# React Photos App

This is for diving deeper into React, including topics of: User events, Fetch and List display

Kowalski, are you there?

## App Summary
- With this Photos App I went into depth on handling user input with Forms and Events
- This application used the external API from Unsplash.com
- The connection provided returns photos that match the search term ie: dogs returns photos of dogs
- What was learned:
  - Component Design and project structure
  - Creating Forms for the user
  - Creating, altering and handling Events and Submittals
  - Solving Context Issues
  - Connecting an external API(Unsplash) and ability to request/retrieve/display data
  - Fetch vs Axios and `.then` vs Async Await
  - Controlled and Uncontrolled elements
  - Communicating from Child to Parent and invoking callbacks in Children
  - So far, different styling with Grid CSS/CSS and JS/React

- A few things that do not work in the App:
  - 012819
  - Currently the Photos App will return only 10 photos(I'm working on that)
  - Currently the photos returned have spacing issues(also being worked on)
  - There isn't much of a utilization app, it's meant to return data from an external API
  - A user will only be able to search for photos to be returned and will get a display
